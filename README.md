# Health Tracking

A few years ago, I wanted to get on top of some gut and skin health issues I was having. I started taking notes with [health.lancegoyke.com](health.lancegoyke.com) so that I could easily share the notes my doctor while getting practice with the Markdown syntax and static sites.

I published this for free on Netlify.
