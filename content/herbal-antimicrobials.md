# Herbal Antimicrobial Protocol

Here's the broad-spectrum herbal anti-microbial protocol recommended to me by Dr. Bryan Walsh.

- Para-Shield (Davinci Labs) – 1 capsule, twice a day
- Intestibal (Pharmax) - 1 gel cap, twice a day
- ViraCon (Vital Nutrients) – 1 capsule, twice a day
- Mushroom Complex SAP (NHF) – 1 capsule, three times a day
- GI MicrobX (Designs for Health) – 2 capsules, three times a day, with meals
- Saccharomyces boulardii (Klaire Labs) – one capsule, twice a day, with meals.
- Candicid Forte (Orthomolecular) – two capsules, twice a day (will need two bottles)
- Silvercillin (DFH) – 1-2 tsp, twice a day is considered a maintenance dose, and doubling it can be used for acute cases. Thus I would use it in the following fashion:
  - 1 tsp twice a day for 2-3 days
  - Two tsp, twice a day for 2-3 days
  - Three tsp, twice a day for 2-3 days
  - Four tsp, twice a day for the remainder of the protocol

I began this protocol on Wednesday, August 12th, 2020.
