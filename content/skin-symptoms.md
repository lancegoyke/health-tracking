## History

Skin is one of my primary concerns (accompanied by gut symptoms and cognition). It has been troublesome to treat because these symptoms been around for as long as I can remember.

The most frustrating ailments are an insatiable urge to itch (pruritis) and dry, red, scaly skin (eczema).

## Symptoms

### Location

The following skin symptoms almost always occur at my joints. At the time of writing, I have them in the following places:

- Right hand, entire 3rd digit
- Right hand, distal 4th digit
- Left hand, middle 5th digit
- Left hand, lateral, proximal 4th digit
- Left hand, in webbing between 3rd and 4th digits
- Left anterior shoulder
- Left elbow
- Right elbow

### Pruritis

This is absolutely the most frustrating symptom. 

It's like always being tickled, always having ants crawling on you or bugs flying around you. It makes my skin and other senses very sensitive. So sensitive that a loving touch from my significant other registers as noxious or pain.

Outside of the hypersensitivity, it's also just distracting. My attention will constantly be pulled away from whatever I'm doing and onto the itchy areas.

When the pruritis is worst it will wake me up in the middle of the night.

Whatever areas are itchy later develop eczema.

### Eczema

I have eczema in tons of places, especially around my joints.

Dr. Nett recommended The Eczema Company for some natural supplements that may reduce my skin symptoms. Namely:

- EczeHerbal #2 - Itchy Skin Rash Treatment
- Organic Manuka Skin Soothing Cream

Conventional medicine has recommended

- Hydrocortizone

## Treatments

### Hydrocortizone

This is traditionally the topical cream I've been prescribed by conventional medicine doctors.

My mother used to take me to see the asthma/allergy specialist and even occasionally the dermatologist. "Oh yeah, that's eczema. Take this cream to make it go away."

It totally works, but it's a steroid and not recommended to be a long-term solution. If I ever stopped taking it, the symptoms would just come back.

### EczeHerbal #2

After taking this for 4 days, I've decided it definitely works.

When testing this product, my itchiness had been really bad, but would respond quickly to this cream.

The issues I have with it are just that when the cream gets worn or washed away, it stops working. It leaves the skin feeling wet and I don't really want to touch anything, but that's an acceptable side effect.

## Triggers

### Tomatos

We have had a "heavy tomato" diet the past week or so, but especially the last two days. We made chili with tomatoes, red bell pepper, onion, squash, kidney beans, black beans, and ground turkey. Then the following night we made chickpea pasta with tomato sauce, tomatoes, onion, and mushrooms.

Having them back-to-back really showed me that even after my herbal anti-microbial protocol, I can't go crazy on the nightshades.

We decided to take tomatoes back out of our diets. I only had a little bit of leftover chili today and my itchiness is HEAPS better. I still had some mushrooms for breakfast and squash for dinner. The onion and bell pepper are likely culprits that may need to be tested again in the future, but we're going to start with tomatoes.
