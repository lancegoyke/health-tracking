## Healthy Habits

I've had some recent success with Sam Harris's Waking Up meditation app. Dr. Nett highly recommended turning this into a daily habit. I had been thinking about giving it a real shot for a few weeks now, so I'm going to commit to daily at least for the month.

"Mindfulness can lower markers of inflammation, improve cognitive health and mood and may help lessen some of your muscle tension. Some meditation teachers and researchers feel that the most benefit comes from consistency, even over duration."

## High Iron

In July 2020 blood tests, my ferritin came back at 550 ng/mL (ref range 38-380 ng/mL). Very high.

The biggest concern here is that iron oxidizes, just as we see in rusty iron everywhere. I might be a type of person that benefits from extra anti-oxidants merely to combat my iron overload.

Treatment strategies:

- Don't cook in cast iron as that's an unnecessary source of iron
- Take calcium and microcrystallized hydroxyapatite (MCHC) supplements when eating red meat to decrease iron absorption.
- Donate blood. It's likely I won't notice normal iron levels until after 2-3 donations waiting at least 8 weeks between donations. My red blood cells are high enough to not be too concerned about anemia.

Alternative strategies:

- Eat less red meat

## Skin

Skin is one of my primary concerns (accompanied by gut symptoms and cognition). I have eczema in tons of places, especially around my joints. Last night, I woke up to my right middle finger itching. The worst part is the pruritis, or urge to itch, not the skin's composition.

Dr. Nett recommended The Eczema Company for some natural supplements that may reduce my skin symptoms. Namely:

- EczeHerbal #2 - Itchy Skin Rash Treatment
- Organic Manuka Skin Soothing Cream

## Supplements

These were ordered through Fullscript.

### Quercetin

Quercetin Plus from Natura Health Products ($33.29 for 90 capsules)

- Natural antihistamine
- Start with one or two capsules and see how it feels
- Can take up to three capsules, three times a day
- Goal being to stop cetirizine, 365-day allergy medication
- Serving size: 1 capsule
  - Quercetin: 350 mg
  - Organic nettle leaf: 50 mg
  - Bromelain: 50 mg
  - Vitamin C: 50 mg

Worth noting: vitamin C increases uptake of iron, of which I have too much.

### Fish Oil

Integrative Therapeutics Pure Omega Ultra HP ($57.60 for 90 softgels)

- May help allergies, asthma, and skin symptoms (and perhaps cognition, too)
- Take 2-3 softgels with dinner
- Serving size: 1 softgel
  - EPA: 575 mg
  - DHA: 425 mg
  - Other omega-3 fatty acids: 85 mg
  - Total omega-3 fatty acids: 1.085 g

If this doesn't help, we'll try something more potent: SPM Active.

### Magnesium (Glycinate/Malate)

Vital Nutrients Magnesium Glycinate/Malate 120mg ($19.26 for 100 capsules)

- Hard to get adequate amounts from diet, so might be a good supplement to take forever.
- Promotes muscle relaxation, restful sleep, and GI regularity.
- 400 to 600 mg with dinner
- Serving size: 2 capsules
  - Magnesium: 240 mg (50% as magnesium glycinate, 50% as dimagnesium malate)

### Cognitive Nootropic

Integrative Therapeutics Neurologix ($71.55 for 120 capsules)

- Supports cognitive function, focus, and mood.
- Best taken twice daily with meals, but can take all four capsules at once.
- May take up to four weeks to appreciate maximal benefit.
- Most people notice improvement within one week.
- Serving size: 2 capsules
  - Vitamin B6: 5 mg
  - Neumentix® Spearmint: 450 mg
  - Citicholine Cognizin® brand: 250 mg
  - Saffron Stigma Extract: 15 mg

Future option: Synapsin

- Nasal spray blend of gensenoside Rg3 and nicotinamide riboside. NAD+ precursor.

"It is designed to be used for the support of neurological and cognitive health. Laboratory studies report that Rg3 extracted from Panax ginseng helps to support healthy neuronal function. Nicotinamide riboside has been shown to have neuroprotective activity and to support neuronal NAD+ synthesis. Overall I have found this very helpful in settings of suspected neuroinflammation."

### Calcium

Metagenics Bone Builder ($44.55 for 270 tablets, backordered)

- Take with red meat meals to decrease iron absorption
- Serving size: 3 tablets
  - Calcium (as MCHC and dicalcium phosphate): 626 mg
  - Phosphorus (as MCHC and dicalcium phosphate): 360 mg
  - Microcrystalline Hydroxyapatite Concentrate (MCHC): 1.5 g

Another MCHC supplement will work if I can't get my hands on this one.

## Testing

These were ordered through Rupa Health.

### Comprehensive Blood Panel

- Overnight fast for 12 hours prior
- Only drink water before the draw
- Drink at least 16 oz of water prior to the draw
- Don't exercise before the draw

### Stool Test

GI360 Three Day Stool Analysis to better understand GI microbiome and overall colon health.

### Repeat SIBO Breath Test (optional)

To see if SIBO persists.

Alternative: assume SIBO persists and treat what we find on the stool test.

If stool test is negative, then it will be important to repeat SIBO breath test.

### Hormones

DUTCH (Dried Urine Test for Complete Hormones) to assess both sex and adrenal hormones.

Collect samples after at least four weeks with no hydrocortisone. This is one of reasons for trying the natural anti-eczema creams above.
