## Reader Beware

I'm going to talk about pooping. I'll try not to be overtly disgusting, but it's an important topic for understanding your health.

## Regularity

I'm usually not surprised if I don't poop in a given day. It seems to happen a lot.

Then, when I *do* poop, it's difficult to predict what it's going to look like. It tends to build up for a long time, then unleash. I'm familiar with the "iceberg" poop, where you see some floating, only to realize the mound underneath the surface.

Years ago, I read an article on a training website talking about what kinds of poops you should be expecting.

- At least one event every day
- At least twelve total inches every day
- Not soft, not firm, but solid consistency

I've never been totally sure how to measure that last one. I try to just use intuition. But that's a conversation for another day.

I hadn't been able to really evaluate the validity of this article I had read because I didn't really have personal experience that told me it was possible. I was just too irregular. But now, I might be seeing the light...

## Summary

My update today is to say: I've been going every day for a few days, they've been about a foot long, and shaped just like a log.
