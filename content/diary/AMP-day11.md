## Weekly Cheat Meal

Allison and I cook every meal during the week except for Friday dinners. We take that time to work out together and then go to In N Out to get a bunch of meat, lettuce, and fries.

Oddly enough, this fast food option seems to have the fewest negative consequences of any of the other places we've tried. Plus, it's cheaper.

I'll get two 4-patty burgers with only the strange sauce they put on them. Both wrapped in lettuce. Then I'll add on two orders of fries. It used to be only one order, but I'm hungry!

I eat the burgers first and usually feel totally fine. Then I'll eat the fries and that's when I start to feel uncomfortable.

Yesterday was no exception. Around the time I finished the first batch of fries, I could really feel the bloat in my belly. Again, these symptoms are overall better than any other "ordering out" option we've found, so this isn't the worst thing I've experienced. But definitely not something I would wish on others.

Usually these symptoms last until I wake up the next day, but after about an hour, while reading in bed, I noticed the bloating was mostly gone.

So I'm glad I'm still taking these pills, but they seem to be helping with my bloating.

## Poop Update

Though I've been consistent most of the week, poop game is definitely not as strong today after the cheat meal last night.
