## Brief Recent History

We're coming off a birthday weekend for Allison. We went off our usual diets for about four days, and definitely felt the consequences.

I started the [anti-microbial protocol](../herbal-antimicrobials.md) yesterday.

## Current State

I felt mostly fine yesterday during day one. Burped up plenty of oregano.

Worth noting: I did not poo yesterday. I am today, but it's a little slower and drier than I'd like.

Also considering adding an oral probiotic to prevent thrush per the recommendation of a friend who learned the hard way.

Other than that, things are going swimmingly. I set a bunch of alarms on my phone and haven't missed one yet.
