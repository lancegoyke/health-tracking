## Surprised

After a full five days back on our normal diet, I'm a little surprised to announce I am still quite itchy. I have a few patches of dry skin and some got bad enough to break the skin.

My current hypothesis is that perhaps some of the bacteria are dying off and releasing lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which is setting off my immune system. To confirm, I need to evaluate a few things:

When is LPS released? Do the gram-whatever bacteria release it like a gun shot? Or is it contained in the cell wall and only released when the bacteria dies? Or is it in the membrane?

## Breath Test Results

I received the results of my lactulose breath test yesterday. I'll get around to posting it here, but my methane production was almost too high and my hydrogen production was definitely too high.

I would have expected them both to be higher, though. And actually a little surprised methane wasn't higher given it seems more common with constipation symptoms.

## Energy and Respiration

Small anecdote, not sure how significant, but I've felt like I have had more energy at night and I've felt like I can breathe better. It almost feelsl like I've taken a few puffs of albuterol inhaler.

Not sure if this is an anomaly or data. But I'll take the extra night reading energy!
