## Rejecting My Weekly Cheat Meal

On the weekends, I usually look forward to a little In-N-Out. The fries aren't that great and the meat comes with basically nothing on it when I order it protein style, no onion, and no tomato, so I don't find it tasty enough to *really* overeat. Plus, minimal ingredients have always helped keep my symptoms at bay.

I love that time Allison and I spend together, not worrying about raw meat, dishes, and cutting vegetables. It's a nice break.

Last Friday (August 28th, 2020), though, I did not want any of those things. I didn't even eat the fries, and I can probably count the number of times I didn't finish a meal on my fingers.

I've had a similar feeling before where it seems like my tongue wants to push the food out instead of taking it in.

Now, **Palate fatigue** is real. I figured it was just that I didn't want to eat the same foods again. And I also thought it would pass. But it persisted all weekend. I ended up eating all sorts of bad stuff, like pizza and cupcakes. I even found myself craving the cake part of a cupcake; I have never desired cake in my life. The ice cream I needed so badly that we went out to get it... that's been done before.

## Less Hunger

What's even more interesting: I did not eat hardly anything all day Sunday. One meal in the middle of the day felt like enough. This was a day after the pizza fiasco, so I attribute some of it to that, but this is very out of the ordinary.

Another possible influence: decreased activity throughout the week. I had been doing one or two workouts or walks a day when this antimicrobial protocol started, but that has halted the last few weeks as lightning-started wildfires surround us. See [SCU Lightning Complex](https://www.google.com/search?q=SCU+Lightning+Complex&oq=SCU+Lightning+Complex&aqs=chrome..69i64j0l4j69i60l3.430j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) and [CZU Lightning Complex](https://www.google.com/search?q=CZU+Lightning+Complex&oq=CZU+Lightning+Complex&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l7.344j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)

Though activity has been lower as we can't go outside for walks very often, I have never experienced hunger levels like this. I **have** noticed extreme hunger when my activity level jumps *up*, but never the reverse.

## Other Wildfire Information

Though not walking outside, I have attempted to move around very slightly indoors. It's a challenge, though, since our place is only so long before I have to turn around.

I have also been coughing and wheezing due to particulate inhalation. Asthma is back, but not super serious. It would just be a really bad time to contract COVID-19. I doubt it, but maybe the lungs could have something to do with my hunger levels or cravings.

## Severe Cramps

When I was a kid, I used to eat **way** too much candy at one time, after which I would find myself stuck on the toilet with severe, lower abdominal cramps. I haven't experienced them like this in probably ten years, but I had a taste of what is was like a few weeks ago after starting the protocol. They were welcomed, however, as they had been followed by some perfect poops. I likened it to GI muscle contraction and motility.

Those cramps were fine, but last night I had some persistent, painful cramps over the course of a hour or hour and half. We had a normal dinner of chicken thighs, red kale, jasmine rice, and black beans. I have been pooping with irregularity, but have not had any of those illustrious poops since at least Friday. I write this on Wednesday morning.

I did end up pooping last night towards the tail end of the cramps. It took a long time, but I figured the pain would be more likely to stop if I moved out some of the poison.

## Water Intake

I have found poops more likely to happen if I drink extra water, so I've been trying to add another pint to my morning routine. My daily intake has been pretty good up until now, but wondering if I could benefit from a little more. With the front-loading of this new system, and lots of coaching hours in the late afternoon, there's a chance I'm dehydrated by the end of the day. This is especially true at present with the wildfires and our in-home air purifiers running all day.
