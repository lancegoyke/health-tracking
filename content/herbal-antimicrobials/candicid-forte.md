### Biotin, 300 mcg

[PubMed search results](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=biotin+candida&filter=pubt.review&filter=pubt.systematicreview)

Starting at a low level, biotin is an essential cofactor for four human carboxylases, encompassing lipid synthesis, amino acid metabolism, and gluconeogenesis.
1. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (acetyl-CoA -> malonyl-CoA)
2. beta-Methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (involved in leucine catabolism)
3. Propionyl-CoA carboxylase (propionyl-CoA -> succinyl-CoA)
4. Pyruvate carboxylase (formation of oxaloacetate from pyruvate)

Biotin prevents yeast, especially *Candida albicans*, from converting to its more invasive, mycelium state.

Biotin deficiency can lead to dermatitis and alopecia. The skin lesions often contain *Candida albicans*.
- Mock D. M. (1991). Skin manifestations of biotin deficiency. Seminars in dermatology, 10(4), 296–302.

Serum biotin measurements are probably not going to tell you anything.
- Abdel Rahman, S. H., Mohammed Salem, R., & Hassan Sabry, J. (2020). Biotin Deficiency in Telogen Effluvium: Fact or Fiction?. The Journal of clinical and aesthetic dermatology, 13(3), 37–40.

"After four days of oral biotin, 10 mg/per day, the metabolites in her urine were significantly reduced, suggesting a biotin-responsive multiple carboxylase deficiency."
- Cowan, M. J., Wara, D. W., Packman, S., Ammann, A. J., Yoshino, M., Sweetman, L., & Nyhan, W. (1979). Multiple biotin-dependent carboxylase deficiencies associated with defects in T-cell and B-cell immunity. Lancet (London, England), 2(8134), 115–118. [https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(79)90002-3](https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(79)90002-3)

"Biotin-dependent multiple carboxylase enzyme deficiency is associated with a chronic dermatitis, alopecia, ataxia, and secondary infection of the skin with Candida. The disorder responds promptly to the administration of biotin with correction of dermatologic, neurologic, and immunologic abnormalities."
