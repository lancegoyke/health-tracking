### Pau D'Arco (Tabebuia impetiginosa) Bark Powder, 100 mg

[PubMed search results](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=Pau+D%27Arco+bark+powder)

"The present study examined the efficacy of finely ground powder from the inner bark of TA, available under the name of Taheebo-NFD-Marugoto (TNM). [...] TNM treatment downregulated ESR-1 (gene for ER-α), aromatase and progesterone gene expression and reduced mRNA levels of E2 target genes pS2, GRB2 and cyclin D1. Inhibition of aromatase activity, based on the NFD content of TNM was superior to the clinical AIs Letrozole and Exemestane. These data demonstrated the potential efficacy of TNM as a nutritional alternative for current therapy of aromatase positive, post-menopausal breast cancer." This is from a different species of tree, but seems to inhibit aromatase activity and overall estrogen load.

"With regard to antimicrobial activity, aqueous extract exhibited antibacterial activity against gram positive (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureu,) and gram negative (Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonia) strains and antifungal activity against Candida albicans. While methanol extract showed antimicrobial activity against all the tested micro organisms except two (Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans), the extracts of hexane, chloroform and ethyl acetate did not show any anti microbial activity. [...] Aqueous and methanol extracts exhibited strong antioxidant activity (80%-90% of the standard)."
