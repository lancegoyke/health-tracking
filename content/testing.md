## Use and abuse of hydrogen breath tests

This post is a review of [a research article from 2006 by M Simren and P-O Stotzer.](https://sci-hub.tw/http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/gut.2005.075127)
This post is a review of a research article from 2006 by M Simren and P-O Stotzer.

## Basics of testing

The idea is that you eat easy-to-digest foods for 24 hours prior to your test, then you eat nothing except a lactulose solution for the duration of the test. This allows most of the food to be cleared from your gastrointestinal tract for testing time.

The lactulose is used because it is only digestible by bacteria in the gut, not by our entercytes. The bacteria get this food, then produce hydrogen or methane gas, which is measured in your exhalation at regular intervals.

Smoking raises hydrogen production. Exercise lowers hydrogen production. Therefore, neither are allowed during testing.

## Problems

There may be some bacteria in there that you don't want, but they might not produce hydrogen or methane. They could be doing you harm, but not measured on the test. This situation could lead to false negative results.

False positives may result from carbohydrate malabsorption in chronic pancreatitis and celiac disease. The gas is produced from fermentation in the colon.

Delayed transit could produce false negatives.

Rapid transit could produce false positives.

Oral bacteria or not adhering to low fiber diet the day prior to testing could also lead to false positives.

## Carbohydrate malabsorption

With poor secretion or activity of pancreatic amylase or intestinal epithelial lactase, maltase, and sucrase, carbohydrates may not be able to break down into simple sugars for absorption. If they make it to the colon still as complex carbohydrates, then they will be fermented, which can lead to the gas problems. The three most studied carbohydrates that may be culprits are lactose, fructose, and sorbitol. More complex carbohydrates could be at least as problematic, though.

### Lactose malabsorption

Lactose is a dairy disaccharide cleaved into galactose and glucose by the enzyme lactase, found in the brush border of the small intestinal epithelium.

Lactose would stick around too long if there were a lactase deficiency or secondary to disorders of the epithelium, like celiac disease. Lactase deficiency is more likely for certain races:

- 3-8% in Scandinavia and Northwest Europe
- 70% in southern Italy and Turkey (southen and eastern Europe)
- ~100% in southeast Asia

The most common test (as of 2006) for lactase deficiency is the lactose hydrogen breath test. It works just like the aforementioned lactulose breath test, but instead of ingesting lactulose, the patient ingests lactose. Positive test results mean an increase of 10-20 ppm above baseline hydrogen values. It's worth paying attention to gastrointestinal distress during the test, as well.

Lactose maldigesters can usually tolerate small amounts of lactose, up to 12.1 grams, daily with minimal or no symptoms.

It seems lactase deficiency is no more common in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) than it is in normal populations. Therefore, lactase could be a red herring.

### Fructose malabsorption

Fructose occurs as a ketohexose or as sucrose, which is cleaved by sucrase into glucose and fructose. It's commonly used as an added sweetener and in fruits. It is absorbed by carrier-mediated facilitated diffusion.

The capacity for fructose absorption is apparently small. One study observed 10% absorption in a 50 gram solution of fructose. Plus, simultaneous ingestion of glucose increases fructose absorption. The opposite is observed when fructose is co-ingested with sorbitol.

The fructose test is similar to the lactose test, both in methodology and in usefulness.

Prevalence is also similar in patients with IBS to normal populations.
